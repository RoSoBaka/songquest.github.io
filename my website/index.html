	<p class="p1"> My name is Roman Safonov; good day. I'm a 22-year-old Lithuanian native
	who was born in <br>Klaipeda. I'm really passionate about a variety of interests. Skateboarding,
	programming,<br> playing video games, and having meaningful conversations with people from various
	cultures and countries<br> are a few of them. But my most cherished and persistent pastime is singing
	and playing the guitar.<br>When I was 13 years old,I started taking official lessons with a music teacher and did so for a whole year.
	<br>After that, I started a 10-year adventure in which I learned and mastered cover songs on the guitar and sang
	them to life. <br>This pairing of singing and guitar playing has been a consistent source of happiness and artistic expression.  </p>

	<p class="p2"> I had chances to show off my musical abilities during my formative years in a variety of contexts,
	including school,<br> high school events, summer camps, and even once on a public bus. My love for performing covers 
	of songs that<br> were very dear to me usually took center stage during these performances. I always carried my trusty
	guitar with<br>me when I entered a performing area or a stage. The guitar was more than simply a tool for me; 
	it was also my compass,<br> allowing me to direct my attention on the music and calming my nerves before performances.
	The photo up top was taken<br> during one of these special occasions when I was 16 and performing at a summer camp. </p>
